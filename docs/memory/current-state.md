# Current State — Aegis

**Updated:** 2026-06-07 (session end — async approve + Phoenix docs; all uncommitted)
**Phase:** **Execution — showcase hardened (committed `19a644b`); Cloud Run posture + Phoenix split + async approve documented in working tree; live credentialed rehearsal still pending.**

### Phoenix projects & recorders (authoritative — do not confuse)
| Service | Phoenix project | Recorder |
|---|---|---|
| v1 `aegis-v1-api` | **`default`** | `OtelPhoenixRecorder` |
| swarm `aegis-swarm-api` | **`aegis-hackathon`** | `OtelSwarmTraceRecorder` |

No project named `aegis-swarm` exists. v1 pinned in `main_v1.py`; swarm in `main_swarm.py` / `Dockerfile.swarm`. Full rationale: [decision-log.md §2026-06-07 Phoenix project split](decision-log.md).

### 2026-06-07 - Session end (async approve + Phoenix project docs)
- **Async approve:** `POST /approve` returns immediately; promotion + post-measure run in background; checkpointed so promotion never runs twice; resume continues half-finished approval. Frontend polls to completion.
- **Phoenix split documented:** v1 → `default` + `OtelPhoenixRecorder`; swarm → `aegis-hackathon` + `OtelSwarmTraceRecorder`. `main_swarm.py` stale `aegis-swarm` default fixed. Decision log §2026-06-07 + AGENTS.md + demo cheatsheet + ADRs.
- **Earlier this day (committed `b62738b`):** Cloud Run docs, 10s poll, demo status script.
- **Earlier this day (committed `19a644b`):** learning-loop robustness + day-zero reset.
- **Uncommitted:** 21 files (backend approve/async, Phoenix docs, showcase poll, tests). Last commit: `b62738b`.

### 2026-06-07 - Showcase learning-loop robustness (committed `19a644b`)
- Library search/discovery failures now degrade gracefully — drafting and optimization continue without citations.
- Unified Gemini fallback: `gemini-3.5-flash` + `thinking_level=high` for drafter, simulator, judge, and reflection.
- Showcase robustness: per-case isolation, plain-English errors, minimum-training guard (50%), checkpoint/resume (`POST /v1/showcase/runs/{id}/resume`).
- Day-zero restore snapshot + `backend/scripts/reset_to_day_zero.py` for blank-slate demo recovery.
- Verification: `aegis_v1` tests 80 passed; full unit 301 passed, 5 pre-existing failures (unrelated).
- Remaining: live credentialed rehearsal; redeploy to Cloud Run with current `deploy-v1.sh`.

### 2026-06-06 - Showcase redesign implementation pass
- Manifest moved to the redesigned split: quick = 8 train + 2 holdout; serious = 80 train + 20 holdout; quick train/holdout are subsets of serious train/holdout respectively.
- Serious holdout is slice-balanced across Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare × medical_necessity/prior_authorization with medium appeal-difficulty score where available.
- `LearningCoordinator` now supports multi-slice candidates (drafter + one playbook per slice); showcase quick/serious runners use multi-slice by default, with single-slice retained only as a fallback concept.
- Quick runner now follows the redesigned pre-approval flow: holdout pre-measure → training pre-row → Phoenix/judge GEPA training → candidate training post-row → PM approval state.
- Serious runner exists and uses the same flow over serious train/holdout.
- Added reject endpoint/status and JSON-backed LIFO promotion rollback stack; approval now snapshots rollback state before promotion and post-measures on holdout.
- Added mid-loop cancellation polling in measurement/training-signal loops and a conservative regression warning (`APPROVE→DENY` flip or mean score drop >5%).
- Frontend now has the primary 6-box learning matrix: Demo and Serious columns, Pre/Training/Post boxes, before/after training rows, green/red case blocks, Reject, Roll back, disabled Serious button until quick success, and a regression banner.
- Verification: focused backend showcase/measurement/coordinator tests 31 passed; frontend `tsc`, lint, tests, and build passed. Full backend unit suite: 286 passed, 5 known/pre-existing failures unrelated to showcase (case-generator anchor, missing `case_500_*`, `/tmp/harness` setup).
- Remaining: live credentialed rehearsal in the real environment; PM visual review on a machine that can run the frontend; redeploy + smoke-test Cloud Run showcase with `--no-cpu-throttling` / single-instance settings (decision logged 2026-06-07).

### 2026-06-06 - Showcase baseline reset to day-zero
- Active drafter prompt flipped from `drafter_v2` → `drafter_v1` everywhere (`/v1/appeal`, showcase pre-measure, GEPA seed all default to v1 now).
- 6 day-zero playbook files created (Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare × medical_necessity/prior_authorization) with single useless tactic each, version `"day_zero"`.
- `drafter_v2.md` archived to `backend/app/aegis_v1/prompts/archive/`; copy kept in active dir for legacy `/showcase/evaluate` endpoint compatibility.
- Redesign plan: `docs/plans/2026-06-06-v1-showcase-redesign-plan.md` — current source for the implemented quick/serious showcase workflow and remaining operational rehearsal work.
- Status: foundation reset done; reject, serious runner, rollback, regression warning, cancellation polling, and primary 6-box UI are locally implemented.

### 2026-06-06 - V1 showcase GEPA quick/serious plan is current
- New current planning source of truth: `docs/plans/2026-06-06-v1-showcase-gepa-quick-serious-plan.md`.
- The older 4-held-out-set / 8-training-set evolution plan is superseded for the immediate v1 showcase push.
- Current direction: v1 only; borrow swarm split discipline, not swarm runtime.
- Quick run: targeted 10-case cohort, preferably single insurer + single denial type; may promote with PM approval and rollback checkpoint.
- Serious run: locked until quick success; if quick promoted, serious starts from the quick-approved prompt/playbook checkpoint; train on the serious pool and preserve clean held-out measurement, recommended `serious_train` 11-90 and `serious_holdout` 91-100 if quality/coverage allow.
- Carry forward from older plans: measurement stages are Phoenix-off, judge-off, learning-off; training can use Phoenix/judges; use explicit run modes, session ledger, promotion gates, cancellation, and accessible UX language.

### 2026-06-05 - Live showcase learning UX working drafts
- Superseded by the 2026-06-06 quick/serious plan above. Keep this entry as historical context only.
- Added two working draft plans, not approved implementation specs:
  - `docs/specs/2026-06-05-live-showcase-learning-ux-plan.md`
  - `docs/specs/2026-06-05-v1-demo-benchmark-split-plan.md`
- Current shared direction: `/showcase` should support a live HITL learning workflow with pre-test and post-test stages that use no Phoenix, no judges, and no learning annotations; training is the only stage that can use Phoenix/judges.
- Retired split model: first 100 draft cases as 20 held-out in 4 sets + 80 training in 8 sets. Do not implement that model unless the PM explicitly reopens it.
- Open questions remain in both draft docs and should be resolved before implementation.

### ✅ phoenix_mcp_lookup NO LONGER COLD_START
- Returns `status='available'` with real `failure_patterns` and `success_traits` when traces exist for the slice.
- MCP-off counterfactual (`PHOENIX_MCP_ENABLED=false`) still returns `disabled` — demo toggle intact.
- See `phoenix_mcp.py` (MCP-first, client-fallback) + `tools.py` (`_summarize_traces` pure transform).

### ✅ LivePhoenixLearningStore built
- `PhoenixLearningStore` Protocol over real `phoenix.client` reads + Phoenix Prompts registry writes.
- `rows_to_scored_runs` pure transform (offline-tested against `tests/fixtures/phoenix/`).

### ✅ v1 backend deployed to Cloud Run
- URL: `https://aegis-v1-api-v6a3eydpoq-uc.a.run.app`
- Secret Manager enabled; `phoenix-api-key` secret (v2) mounted as `PHOENIX_API_KEY`.
- `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME=default` set authoritatively in `main_v1.py`.

### ✅ Frontend deployed to Cloud Run
- Cloud Build succeeded with the `pnpm@10` pin.
- URL: `https://aegis-frontend-v6a3eydpoq-uc.a.run.app`
- Smoke test verified HTTP 200 on `/`, `/appeal`, and `/showcase`.

### ⚠️ OtelPhoenixRecorder.annotate fix
- `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` in `.env` → `phoenix.client` was using it as base URL, producing 405.
- Fix: pass `PHOENIX_HOST.rstrip('/')+'/'` as `base_url`. Payload simplified to scalars only.

### 🔴 CRITICAL TODO — library before judges / showcase / Phoenix improvement
- **PM is building the library first.** Do not bypass judge panel with simulator scores.
- **Blocker:** live v1 runs return `citations_used: 0` until Vertex library env is wired (`VERTEX_SEARCH_*` in `.env`/Cloud Run). Judges need citations; panel score stays empty without them.
- **`phoenix_mcp_lookup` still stub** (cold_start) — traces land in Phoenix but memory does not improve drafts yet.
- **Order:** (1) library indexed → (2) runtime wired + citations on `/v1/appeal` → (3) librarian when thin → (4) judge panel + live `/showcase` eval → (5) Phoenix MCP reads. See latest handoff in `agent-handoffs.md` (2026-06-03 CRITICAL).

### ⚠️ EVAL CORPUS — DO NOT TRUST CURSOR SIGN-OFF (2026-06-03)
- PM reports **~5 days wasted** on false "full Gumloop / 500 APPROVE" claims from Cursor agent.
- **`eval/gumloop_runs/true-swarm-500/`** and **`run_true_gumloop_all_500.py`** are **not** valid proof of Gumloop pass.
- **Corpus readiness** = PM re-runs Gumloop (or trusted external chat) on samples + full set; see `docs/memory/learnings.md` (2026-06-03 eval trust breach).
- Partial Cursor fixes may exist in `eval/cases/drafts/` (cases 02, 03, 05, algo batch, etc.) — **verify independently** before `approved/`.
- ✅ Generated **case 104** (UHC Prior Auth imaging emergency_retroactive_auth) manually using harness_io state-machine.
- PM intent: **terminate Cursor subscription**; future agents must not ask PM to trust prior Cursor eval statements.

### Session (2026-06-03 — Cloud library + Vertex AI Search)
- ✅ **Library corpus IA:** metadata schema, ADR-008, runbook, controlled vocab, **66-entry** redistributable seed catalog.
- ✅ **Ingest pipeline:** download → stage → manifest → GCS upload script; priority-1 (**~29 docs**) in `gs://aegis-library-dm1oaz/library/v1/`.
- ✅ **Vertex AI Search live:** data store `aegis-library-content-v1` (`CONTENT_REQUIRED`), engine `aegis-engine-content-v1`; live queries return GCS-linked hits.
- ✅ **Spot-check queries:** `eval/library/spot_check_queries.json` (40 queries derived from 500 draft cases).
- ✅ **`vertex_search.py`:** GCS URI → `corpus_doc_id` for citation paths when metadata lacks `doc_id`.
- ⏭️ **Next:** wire `VERTEX_SEARCH_*` + `AEGIS_LIBRARY_BUCKET` into `.env`/Cloud Run; E2E `POST /v1/appeal` with grounded citations; expand to full 66-doc catalog; commit when PM asks.
- 📁 **Local staging kept** at `/tmp/aegis-library-staging` (PM rule — do not delete without explicit OK).

### Session (Part A v1 librarian + frontend product model)
- ✅ **Built Part A library path (offline-tested):** Search Planner + pre-flight `prepare_library_context` (cloud store seam, up to 5 trust-gated discovery fetches, Layer 3 query refinement stub). Spec **Approved**: `docs/specs/2026-06-01-aegis-v1-cloud-corpus-surgical-discovery-feature-spec.md`.
- ✅ **PM decision applied (cloud-only, transparent failure):** v1 does **not** store corpus locally; when Vertex AI Search isn’t configured, runs are best-effort but **ungrounded** (no citations) with an explicit `library_unavailable_no_cloud_index` risk flag. If `discovery_enabled=true` without cloud library, API returns **503** (no silent toggles).
- ✅ **Frontend aligned to PM model:** `/appeal` = **always live** (`consumerSource`); `/showcase` = **recorded** judge evidence (`showcaseSource`). Removed consumer “practice mode” default — was a misread of demo vs product.
- ✅ **Settings:** backend URL + connection check + discovery toggle (default on). `docs/demo-cheatsheet-pm.md` for PM demo flow.
- ⏭️ **Not committed.** Next: commit when PM asks; record Devpost video (live appeal → showcase); optional ADK agent pre-flight parity.

### Session 29 (500-case eval corpus + A+ pipeline integration)
- ✅ **`eval/cases/drafts/`:** **500** cases (`case_01`–`case_500`) — ERISA-style letters, web-cache references, claim-file / P2P enhancements.
- ✅ **`build_aplus_case`:** default `use_web_research=True`, `enhance_denial_letter`, `fit_letter_word_budget` (200–500w).
- ✅ **Scripts:** `upgrade_cases_01_220_web.py` (in-place upgrade), `generate_cases_421_500.py` (80-case extension).
- ⏭️ **Next:** Gumloop approve → `approved/`; optional web-cache refresh; commit when PM requests.

### Session 28 (Part B swarm build — Phase 6: Learning Coordinator re-point DONE)
- ✅ **Phase 6 complete, all tests green (228 unit).**
- ✅ **Credit-map resolver:** `app/learning/credit_resolution.py` — any evolvable pipeline agent (`triage`, researchers, `strategist`, `drafter`, `adversarial_reviewer`, …); weak-v1 trio is starting baseline only; researcher override + corpus-gap paths.
- ✅ **`SwarmLearningCoordinator`:** `app/learning/swarm_coordinator.py` — GEPA loop over full swarm seed; one component per child; `CorpusGapRecommendation` when retrieval dominates.
- ✅ **`StubSwarmExperimentRunner`:** holdout scoring with injectable dimension bumps; `swarm_gates.evaluate_swarm_vetoes` (append-only diff cap).
- ✅ **Autonomy ladder (FR-3):** `app/learning/autonomy_ladder.py` — Apprentice/Journeyman/Master + circuit breaker; Master cannot auto-promote `adversarial_reviewer`.
- ✅ **Benchmark loader (FR-4):** `app/learning/benchmark_dataset.py` — deterministic 60/40 from `eval/cases/drafts/`.
- ✅ **CLI:** `backend/scripts/run_swarm_learning_offline.py`
- ⏭️ **Next:** wire live `PhoenixLearningStore` + `LiveSwarmExperimentRunner`; demo UI manual coordinator trigger; `deploy-swarm.sh`; push 26+ commits.

### Session 27 (Part B swarm build — Phase 5: eval harness + MCP counterfactual DONE)
- ✅ **Phase 5 complete, all tests green (207 unit).**
- ✅ **`run_evaluated_swarm_case`:** `app/evals/swarm/evaluated_swarm_run.py` — swarm Student → Phoenix recorder → 7-judge panel → optional simulator → laundered annotations + firewall-safe swarm meta (`swarm_agent_trace_count`, `insurer_phoenix_unavailable`).
- ✅ **Injectable `phoenix_lookup`** on `run_swarm_pipeline` for counterfactual/tests without env mutation.
- ✅ **`run_swarm_counterfactual`:** `app/learning/swarm_counterfactual.py` — MCP on vs off per case, composite delta (offline stub: ~0.17 mean on 2 draft cases).
- ✅ **Stub propagation:** `StubSwarmClient` weaves insurer tactic + Phoenix memory into strategy/letter so offline judges measure a real delta.
- ✅ **Script:** `backend/scripts/run_swarm_counterfactual_offline.py` for demo recording.
- ⏭️ **Next: Phase 6** — Learning Coordinator re-point + `SwarmExperimentRunner` (deferred FR-2/3/4).

### Session 27 (Part B swarm build — Phase 4: live surfaces DONE)
- ✅ **Phase 4 complete, all tests green (88 swarm / 192 unit).**
- ✅ **ADK graph:** `aegis_swarm/agent.py` exposes one `run_swarm_appeal` tool over the pure `swarm_pipeline` core (no logic fork). `main_swarm` mounts `/v1/swarm/appeal` (mirrors Part A).
- ✅ **`VertexSearchCorpusStore`:** `vertex_search.py` + `build_corpus_store()` factory — local BM25 when `VERTEX_SEARCH_DATA_STORE_ID` unset; Discovery Engine backend when set, with local fallback on API failure.
- ✅ **Live discovery seam:** `vertex_discovery.py` + `build_discovery_search_client()` — fake by default; `VertexGroundedDiscoveryClient` when `AEGIS_VERTEX_DISCOVERY=true`. Thin-retrieval hook (`corpus_search_with_discovery`) wired in pipeline (still OFF unless `CORPUS_DISCOVERY_ENABLED`).
- ✅ **Phoenix spans:** `trace_recorder.py` — `OtelSwarmTraceRecorder` emits one child span per `AgentTraceSignal` (firewall-safe attrs only); `AEGIS_SWARM_TRACE_MODE=memory` for offline tests.
- ✅ **Live wiring dial:** `swarm_config.py` — `AEGIS_SWARM_MODE=live` → `GeminiSwarmClient` + `us-central1` default location.
- ⏭️ **Next: Phase 5** — wire swarm into Learning Coordinator re-point + eval layer (FR-2 deferred scope).

### Session 27 (Part B swarm build — Phase 3: weak-v1 trio + per-agent trace signal DONE)
- ✅ **Phase 3 complete, all tests green (68 swarm / 171 unit).**
- ✅ **Three deliberately-weak baselines (PM decision, up from 1):** `drafter`, `strategist`, `medical_necessity` ship as `<role>_v1_weak.md` pinned via `registry.WEAK_V1_AGENTS`; strong `<role>_v1.md` kept on disk as the evolved target. Chosen because they own three distinct, non-overlapping dimensions = **0.75 of the weighted composite** → big AND attributable lift. `insurer_intelligence` (MCP-off counterfactual) and `adversarial_reviewer` (safety gate) kept strong. Weak set is a **config dial**; safety never weakened, only quality.
- ✅ **Registry helpers:** `is_weak_agent`, `weak_agents`, `has_target_reference`, `load_target_reference`; `CURRENT_VERSIONS` pins weak agents to `v1_weak`.
- ✅ **Per-agent firewall-safe trace signal (FR-5):** new `AgentTraceSignal` schema + `tools.make_agent_trace_signal` (stamps `role + prompt_version + is_weak_v1 + owned_dimensions + counts + risk_flags + templated summary`). `swarm_pipeline` emits one per invoked agent into `SwarmRunArtifacts.agent_trace_signals`. Summaries are structural one-liners — NO letter text / brief quotes / `thinking` / PHI (INV-2). `AGENT_OWNED_DIMENSIONS` map (inverted from the credit map) routes each signal to its dimension. Live Phoenix-span wiring is Phase 4.
- ✅ **Evolution-integrity hardening (post-Phase-3):** weak-prompt bodies carry NO "deliberately weak" meta-commentary (would bias generation); rationale moved to `prompts/WEAK_BASELINES.md` (never loaded). Strong reference prompts quarantined to `prompts/targets/<role>.md` — not a loadable version, NEVER an optimizer seed (only `current_version` seeds the loop; success = held-out lift vs weak baseline, not similarity to target). Two new credit-map invariants: "no known-good leakage" + "no experiment metadata in runtime prompts".
- ⏭️ **Next: Phase 4** — live surfaces (ADK graph + `VertexSearchCorpusStore` + Vertex discovery, creds-gated, budget-capped).

### Session 27 (Part B swarm build — Phase 2: full fan-out + discovery DONE)
- ✅ **Phase 2 complete, e2e offline, all tests green (59 swarm / 162 unit).**
- ✅ **Full 5-researcher fan-out:** `tools.py` now carries the real `DENIAL_ROUTING` table (from `triage_v1.md`) + `estimate_complexity`/`complexity_to_depth`/`build_routing`. `insurer_intelligence` is ALWAYS invoked (Phoenix-load-bearing); `precedent_miner` is added on complexity 5 (state-law-sensitive / secondary denial / multi-reason). Stub Triage fans out per the table; the pipeline already looped `manifest.researchers`, so no pipeline rewrite was needed.
- ✅ **Per-domain research behavior** in `StubSwarmClient.research`: each researcher reports its own empty-retrieval flag (`no_guidelines_found`/`no_statute_found`/`cpb_not_found`/`no_precedent_found`/`no_trace_history`) — precedent "no match" no longer masquerades as a gap. Legal adds `state_unknown` + a document-production angle; Policy adds `missing_plan_docs` + a plan-contradiction angle. Strategy `degraded` now means "no findings anywhere" (a legit empty precedent brief doesn't degrade).
- ✅ **LiteratureDiscovery (offline fakes)** — `backend/app/aegis_swarm/literature_discovery.py`: gated pipeline `search → sanitize(secure-*) → trust-tier filter → provenance capture → ingest` + audit log + one-click `remove()`. OFF by default (`CORPUS_DISCOVERY_ENABLED`), rate-limited (per-case + per-day caps, $30/mo guardrail). `sanitize_discovered_content` strips/flags zero-width, HTML comments, hidden CSS, and injection phrases (hidden content ⇒ unsafe ⇒ reject). `DiscoverySearchClient` Protocol + `FakeDiscoverySearchClient` (live Vertex backend is Phase 4). Discovery only feeds the corpus; the corpus stays the sole citation source.
- ⏭️ **Next: Phase 3** — weak-v1 target agent (PRD 15.5) + per-agent firewall-safe trace signal. See latest handoff entry.

### Session 27 (Part B swarm build — Phase 1: walking skeleton DONE)
- ✅ **Phase 1 walking skeleton complete, e2e offline, all tests green (37 swarm / 140 unit).**
- ✅ **Tool/client seam:** `backend/app/aegis_swarm/{tools.py, client.py}`. `tools.py` retrieves via the `CorpusStore` seam + REUSES Part A `playbook_loader`/`phoenix_mcp_lookup` (one shared surface). `client.py` = `SwarmAgentClient` Protocol (`@runtime_checkable`) + `StubSwarmClient` (deterministic, offline) + `GeminiSwarmClient` (live, stub-fallback) — mirrors Part A's injectable `drafter_client`/`simulator_client` pattern; each method loads its prompt from the registry (the credit-assignment unit).
- ✅ **Pure pipeline + orchestrator:** `swarm_pipeline.run_swarm_pipeline` wires Triage→researcher→Strategist→Drafter→Adversarial Reviewer (1-loop on overall_severity≥0.6)→`self_check`→Part A `AppealPackage` + `SwarmRunArtifacts` sidecar. `swarm_orchestrator.run_swarm_appeal_with_outcome` wraps it + runs Part A `simulator` in the eval layer (separation of powers, D11). Reuses Part A `apply_guardrails`, `self_check`, `case_parser`, `simulator`.
- ✅ **Thin slice:** stub Triage routes ONE researcher (medical_necessity); full 5-researcher fan-out + always-on insurer_intelligence is Phase 2. Pipeline already loops over `manifest.researchers`, so Phase 2 only widens the manifest.
- ⏭️ **Next: Phase 2** — full agents + 5-researcher fan-out + LiteratureDiscovery logic (offline fakes). See latest handoff entry.

### Session 27 (Part B swarm build — Phase 0: foundation DONE)
- ✅ **Started the Part B swarm runtime build** (plan `aegis swarm runtime`, offline-first, 7 phases). **Phase 0 complete, all tests green.**
- ✅ **Schemas + registry + CorpusStore:** `backend/app/aegis_swarm/{schemas.py, corpus_store.py, prompts/registry.py}`. Terminal output reuses Part A `AppealPackage`; every agent prompt is a versioned `component_id` (credit-assignment unit); retrieval goes through a `CorpusStore` Protocol (`LocalCorpusStore` offline; `VertexSearchCorpusStore` is Phase 4). 24 new tests pass.
- ✅ **Corpus re-homed** into `corpus/{clinical,legal,precedent,insurer}/` (+ 2 sourced seed docs, `provenance.json`, README). Part A switched to rglob and still passes (43 tests).
- ✅ **Spec-first + ADR-007 + arch 5.6 + credit-assignment-map.md** written (GCP corpus + Vertex trust-gated discovery; $30/mo cap; dimension->agent routing).
- 📝 Correction: prior "frontend not merged" note is stale — `feat/frontend-two-surface` IS on `origin/main`.

### Session 27 (earlier — Demo-readiness audit + Cloud Run deploy scripts + Track B latency finding)
- ✅ **Wrote Cloud Run deploy scripts** (uncommitted): `backend/deploy-v1.sh` (v1 only; `--bootstrap` enables APIs + creates Secret Manager `phoenix-api-key` + grants IAM), `frontend/deploy.sh` (demo mode default, `--mode live --api <url>` for Track B). Both use Cloud Build (`gcloud run deploy --source .`) — no local Docker required. Print plan + ask `[y/N]` before destructive action.
- ✅ **Added `frontend/Dockerfile`** (3-stage Node 20, Next.js standalone, non-root, port 8080) + set `output: 'standalone'` in `next.config.ts`. `.gcloudignore`/`.dockerignore` files added on both sides.
- ✅ **Wrote Track B smoke test** `backend/scripts/smoke_track_b.py` — L1 imports / L2 env / L3 Vertex auth / L4 Phoenix tracing / L5 Outcome Simulator. L1+L2+L3 ✅; L4/L5 unreached.
- 🔴 **Track B live latency is unworkable today.** Gemini `2.5-flash` first call: 155 s for one token; second call: hung past 4 min, killed. Likely cause: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global`. Quickest fix to try: flip to `us-central1` in `.env` + refresh ADC.
- ⚠️ **Frontend build blocked locally** by pnpm `minimumReleaseAge` policy rejecting `vite@8.0.15` (published today). PM's choice: wait, `pnpm clean --lockfile`, or relax policy.
- 📝 **Stale-handoff finding:** Session 26's `feat/frontend-two-surface` IS already merged + pushed to `origin/main` (commits `fcdedfd..daf5f6a`). Prior handoffs said "not merged/pushed" — that's outdated. No action needed beyond noting it.
- ⏭️ Per ADR-006 there are two backend services; only v1 deploy script was built this session (PM-directed). Swarm script (`deploy-swarm.sh`) will mirror it when the swarm is ready.

### Session 26 (Frontend two-surface reimagining — built)
- ✅ **Reimagined the frontend** (was a lone landing page) into **two surfaces, one locked design language**: `/` + `/appeal` = the calm consumer flow (intake → working → mirror → draft → decide, never names the AI); `/showcase` = "How Aegis learns" (judge-facing v1/v3 + diff + memory-off counterfactual). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-01-aegis-frontend-design.md`, plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-01-aegis-frontend.md`.
- ✅ **One `DataSource` seam** (`frontend/src/lib/data/`): **demo default** (bundled fixtures from the real 10 test cases + recorded efficacy run — fully clickable offline, no creds), flips to **live `/v1/appeal`** via `NEXT_PUBLIC_AEGIS_MODE=live` (+ `NEXT_PUBLIC_AEGIS_API`). Types mirror `appeal_api.py`/`schemas.py`; Zod validates fixtures at author time.
- ✅ **Firewall (INV-2) extended to the frontend**: consumer fixtures carry only student-visible fields; `frontend/src/__tests__/firewall.test.ts` asserts no teacher answer-key keys leak. All 10 test cases selectable (PM picks live for the demo); cases 01–04 show **measured** v1/v3 numbers from `eval/efficacy_runs/2026-05-31`, 05–10 labeled illustrative.
- ✅ **Quality:** 17 vitest tests green; `tsc`/`eslint` clean; `pnpm build` prerenders all 4 routes; copy audit clean (no AI/Phoenix/Gemini/ADK or exclamation marks on consumer surfaces); a11y + reduced-motion pass. Branch `feat/frontend-two-surface` (14 commits `d287666..fcdedfd`), **not merged to main, not pushed**.
- ⏭️ Not run: browser-interaction smoke test (Chrome not installed for Playwright) — validated instead via route-200s + static prerender + data-layer unit tests. Noted backend follow-up: have `/v1/appeal` return `parsed_case` + `appeal_strategy` for a richer live Mirror.

- ✅ **PRD §7 / §8 / §15.2 / §15.3 reconciled** with rubric v2 (hard-gate PASS rates as SC2/SC3, per-dimension regression gating, zero-tolerance auto-rollback on hard-gate FAIL).
- ✅ **10 agent prompts rewritten** as full LLM system prompts (persona + domain context + tool-use + CoT + output schema + few-shot + guardrails). Interface contract preserved as docstring section.
- ✅ **Day 1–20 implementation plan** generated via `implementation-plan` skill — [`docs/plans/2026-05-27-aegis-implementation-plan.md`](../plans/2026-05-27-aegis-implementation-plan.md) + companion flat task list. 4 phases, 67 tasks, 11 risks, full PRD-ID traceability. A1–A5 + Day 10 + Day 14/15 gates explicitly scheduled.
- ✅ **Autonomy Ladder thresholds finalized** via `brainstorming` skill (Moderate Scale + Aggressive Master), logged in `decision-log.md`.
- ✅ **Product Soul rewritten** via `product-soul` skill with anti-positioning, values hierarchy, and specific hypotheses.
- ✅ **Project Constitution established** via `project-constitution` skill — `docs/constitution.md` (v1) sets 7 non-negotiable engineering invariants (testing, security, performance, etc.).
- ✅ **Feature Specs written** via `feature-spec` skill for Part A (MVP) and Part B (Swarm). Both are in Draft status pending clarification review.

### Session 6 (Execution)
- ✅ MVP benchmark dataset size cut from 12-cases to 4-cases across all spec and plan documents.
- ✅ Phase 0 setup fully complete: GCP APIs enabled, `PHOENIX_API_KEY` stored in `.env`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` established for PHI/secret checking.
- ✅ Tooling installed: `uv`, `google-agents-cli` (with 7 ADK skills via Node).
- ✅ **Backend scaffolded:** Task T1.1 done. Created standard ADK FastAPI app using `agents-cli create -a adk`, added custom `/health` endpoint (returns `{"ok":true}`).
- ⏸️ **Frontend scaffold:** Paused by PM. No Next.js app generated yet.
- ✅ **Memory closed:** Session 6 handoff finalised; current-state updated.
- ✅ **A4 spike:** Verified MCP client connects successfully and lists Phoenix trace tools.

### Session 7 (Frontend design system + scaffold — T1.2 done)
- ✅ **frontend-design skill chain run end-to-end** for the first time. Outputs in `.design/aegis/`.
- ✅ **Archetype locked** via `design-archetype` skill — premium-consumer (health-shaded), feels-like One Medical × Headspace, with Calm motion + Apple Health restraint. See `.design/aegis/ARCHETYPE.md`.
- ✅ **Design tokens generated** via `design-tokens-craft` skill — warm-paper neutrals, sage accent, no Tailwind defaults, oklch source-of-truth, hand-set dark mode, motion budget 240–520ms with Calm easing. CSS + TS in `.design/aegis/` and copied to `frontend/src/styles/tokens.{css,ts}`. Banned-defaults audit clean. See `.design/aegis/TOKENS.md`.
- ✅ **Icon strategy locked** via `icon-craft` — mixed: tuned Lucide subset (functional) + 8 bespoke SVGs (signature surfaces). Tuning rules + bespoke inventory in `.design/aegis/ICONS.md`. The 8 bespoke SVGs are drawn during T1.3+; tuning wrapper at `frontend/src/icons/lucide.tsx` is shipped.
- ✅ **T1.2 Next.js scaffolded** (`pnpm`, Next 16.2.6, React 19, Tailwind v4, App Router, src dir, TS strict). Hero page renders with serif display + Inter body, sage signature dot, hairline rules, no exclamation marks, full disclaimer. `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm dev` (HTTP 200) all green.
- ✅ Frontend `AGENTS.md` rewritten to merge Next.js 16 version-specific notice + design-system handoff section.
- ✅ Skill outputs ledger and current-state updated.

### Session 8 (Dev scripts + Vertex AI config)
- ✅ **Dev launcher scripts finished** — `scripts/dev.sh` + `scripts/dev.ps1`. Colored prefixes, .env loading (skip empty values), tool checks, 30s readiness probe, graceful shutdown.
- ✅ **ADC configured** — `gcloud auth application-default login` completed.
- ✅ **Vertex AI (Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform) configured** — backend uses `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` via ADC, location `global`. No API key needed.
- ✅ **`backend/WINDOWS_SETUP.md`** updated with ADC auth section and Vertex AI env vars.
- ✅ **Full end-to-end verified** — `./scripts/dev.sh` starts both services, health check passes.

### Session 9 (Dataset Generation & Eval Architecture - T2.4 Done)
- ✅ **10 Train and 10 Test synthetic cases drafted** for MVP Part A (T2.4 done).
- ✅ **Gumloop 8-agent case evaluation swarm designed** — prompts and architecture documented in `gumloop/`.
- ✅ **Case dataset lifecycle restructured** into strict `drafts/` -> `approved/` folders.
- ✅ **AlphaEval 2026 compliance enforced** — Gumloop & manual prompts updated to use strict 1/3/5 anchor scoring and binary hard gates for LLM Tells / Contradictions.
- ✅ **Manual Evaluation Prompts created** for ChatGPT and Perplexity (Mega-Prompt spot-check mode) with JSON schema output.

### Session 9 (Concurrent — Phoenix telemetry + A4 gate)
- ✅ **T1.3 Phoenix telemetry wired** — traces actively appearing in Phoenix under project `aegis-hackathon` via `openinference-instrumentation-google-adk`.
- ✅ **T1.4 A4 spike pt.1 complete** — MCP query successfully round-tripped and fetched trace data.
- ✅ **T1.5 J1 conflict resolved** — Phoenix is primary; agents-cli observability skill skipped.
- ✅ **T2.1 A4 spike pt.2 complete** — 20 MCP queries, 20/20 successes, p50=1.24s, p95=2.52s. **A4 GATE PASSED.** Phoenix MCP is a load-bearing dependency.
- ✅ **A4 go/no-go decision logged** in `decision-log.md`.

### Session 10 (Concurrent — Case Generator Swarm)
- ✅ **`backend/app/case_generator/` swarm built** — 4 producers + 19 per-stage critics (16 LLM, 3 deterministic) + safety + schema validator + writer.
- ✅ **21 versioned prompt templates** in `backend/app/case_generator/prompts/`.
- ✅ **CLI** `uv run python -m app.case_generator.cli --count N --split {train|test} --seed N --start-index N --dry-run -v`.
- ✅ **Smoke test** produced 1 valid case: `eval/cases/drafts/part-a/test/case_01_aetna_priorauth.json` (Aetna / Prior Auth / behavioral_health / missing_peer_to_peer / TMS for treatment-resistant OCD). All 19 critic verdicts captured in provenance.
- ✅ **Configs externalised**: `eval/diversity_matrix.json`, `eval/banned_topics.json`, `eval/case_schema.json`.
- ✅ **PM course corrections applied**: (1) Drafter+critic both Gemini — need different-family critics (G1: Claude-on-Vertex), (2) Harness Task tool can replace custom file-queue (G2: harness orchestration), (3) No Phoenix tracing needed for offline generation.
- ✅ **Plan for next session**: `docs/plans/2026-05-28-case-generator-harness-claude-plan.md` — G1 (Claude-on-Vertex critic, highest priority), G2 (harness-Task path, optional), G3 (keep Vertex-Python path).

### Session 11 (Demo Capture Planning + Combined Handoff)
- ✅ **Rolling demo capture plan established** — `docs/demo/rolling-capture-checklist.md` with PM-friendly step-by-step instructions for each capture point.
- ✅ **Implementation plan updated** with capture tasks at Days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17.
- ✅ **PM question answered**: Yes, the UX must show the simulator outcome (APPROVE/DENY) — per FR8 and FR10, this is a core demo element. The flip from DENY to APPROVE is one of the most compelling visual moments.
- ✅ **Combined handoff** from 3 concurrent sessions written.

### Session 12 (Execution - aegis_v1 ADK agent)
- Done: **T3.3/T3.4**. `backend/app/agent.py` now exposes `aegis_v1` with the 7 MVP tools: `case_parser`, `corpus_retrieval`, `phoenix_mcp_lookup`, `playbook_loader`, `drafter`, `self_check`, `simulator`.
- Added Pydantic schemas and deterministic tool pipeline under `backend/app/aegis_v1/`: `schemas.py`, `tools.py`, `pipeline.py`.
- Strict JSON path: ADK `output_schema=AppealPackage` plus `response_mime_type="application/json"`.
- Local smoke produced structured `AppealPackage`: Cigna med-necessity, 3 corpus citations, self-check PASS, simulator score 9/10 -> DENY. This preserves the planned weak-v1 demo arc.
- Verification: `pytest tests/unit` -> 8 passed; ADK canonical tools resolve to 7 `FunctionTool`s. Ruff could not run because it is not installed in the backend venv.

### Session 13 (Realistic Imperfection & AlphaEval Gap Fixes)
- ✅ Overhauled architecture to support "Realistic Imperfection" for generated synthetic denial cases.
- ✅ Implemented schema `denial_pattern_sources`, `appeal_difficulty`, and `evaluator_disagreements`.
- ✅ Created `eval/denial_patterns.json` as the source-of-truth corpus for real-world insurer flaws.
- ✅ Recalibrated generator pipeline (`RealisticFlawInjector` added, critics refactored for AlphaEval compliance).
- ✅ Built out 16-agent Gumloop swarm (Tier 1 Hard Gates + Tier 2 Realism/Logical Critics + Meta-Evaluators).
- ✅ Rewrote `gumloop/architecture.md` to document the new multi-tier architecture.
- ⏸️ Generation trial paused due to missing `GEMINI_API_KEY`.


### Session 15 (Generation Pipeline P5)
- ✅ Added `StylisticDiversifier` (P5) to the generation pipeline to ensure clinical/procedural diversity.
- ✅ Re-architected pipeline to separate factual diversity (Orchestrator), logic flaws (P4), and stylistic noise (P5).
- ✅ Added strict safety rules to P5 to preserve P4's injected flaws and timestamps.

### Session 14 (User/Manual updates)
- ✅ Expanded `eval/denial_patterns.json` with a new `category` field and 19 new patterns across 5 categories.
- ✅ Added category 6 `algorithmic_ai_denial` patterns (3 patterns) to `eval/denial_patterns.json`.
- ✅ Simplified category 6 to 3 single-filer-detectable proxy patterns.

### Session 16 & 17 (Documentation Sweep & Multi-Service Topology)
- ✅ Codified the "Weak-v1" Demo arc rule explicitly into PRD Section 15.5.
- ✅ Added "Case Generation Pipeline (Offline Tooling)" Section 8 to the Architecture spec.
- ✅ Documented pipeline mechanics: Realistic Imperfection, Analysis-First rules, Split Scoring, Gumloop Arbiter REVISE logic, and Diversity constraints.
- ✅ Formalised the "Anti-Cheating Firewall" logic for the SkillOpt textual gradient descent structure.
- ✅ Implemented 3-service backend topology (`aegis-v1-api` on 8001, `aegis-swarm-api` on 8002) in `scripts/dev.sh` and created `ADR-006`.

## What's blocked
- **Arize Cloud Auth** — A4 MCP connection works, but Arize auth (`PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS` or API key permissions) blocks actual trace retrieval from the MCP server. Workaround: direct Phoenix SDK calls work; MCP is functional for ADK tool integration (T2.1 proved this with 20/20 successes).

## Active decisions (top items)
- Codename: **Aegis**
- Stack: Google ADK + Gemini 3.1 Pro (Vertex AI / Agent Platform, via ADC) + Phoenix Cloud + Phoenix MCP + Next.js + Python FastAPI + Cloud Run + `google-agents-cli`
- License: Apache 2.0
- Autonomy ladder: 3-stage (Apprentice → Journeyman → Master) — thresholds TBD on Day 5 after judge calibration κ measured
- 12-agent Part B with 4 hard revisit triggers ([ADR-004](../adr/))
- Eval: 7-judge panel, 2 hard gates + 5 weighted, κ ≥ 0.6, per-dim regression gating ([rubric v2](../evals/2026-05-27-aegis-appeal-rubric.md))
- Phase 0 PM-gated; Phase 1 starts Day 1 once PM approves setup
- MVP Day 7 = safety net; Full Plan Day 20 = win condition

## Active risks (top)
- **R-PLAN-1** A4 Phoenix MCP + ADK integration breaks → Day 1–2 spike isolates this; fallback documented
- **R-PLAN-2** A1 eval signal too noisy → Day 5 gate; fallback = recalibrate or kill loop pitch
- **R-PLAN-3** A3 cases read as toy → Day 3 reader test; fallback = real anonymised public letters
- **R-PLAN-5** A5 Coordinator autonomy fails → Day 10 gate; fallback = stay on human-approved loop (MVP-style)
- Time pressure: 20-day window has not started; Phase 0 must clear quickly

### Session 18 (Critical Audit — Droid)
- ✅ Full cross-repo audit of all uncommitted changes from Sessions 15–17.
- ✅ Identified 16 inconsistencies (1 syntax-breaking bug, 4 high, 6 medium, 3 low, 2 deferred).
- ✅ Confirmed architectural direction is sound; inconsistencies are execution-layer cleanup, not design corrections.
- ⚠️ **dev.sh is broken** — duplicate C_RESET + orphaned else/fi block causes bash syntax error. Must fix before any dev work.
- ⚠️ **9+ files reference deleted `fast_api_app.py` and port 8000** — stale references across tests, Dockerfile, docs, scripts.
- ✅ **Phoenix project split documented (2026-06-07)** — v1 → `default` (`OtelPhoenixRecorder`); swarm → `aegis-hackathon` (`OtelSwarmTraceRecorder`). `main_swarm.py` stale `aegis-swarm` default fixed. See decision log §2026-06-07.

### Session 19 (Part A Judge Panel)
- ✅ Approved and documented the Part A judge panel firewall: Aegis v1 gets a `StudentCasePacket`; judges get a teacher-only grading packet with provenance, expected appeal vectors, and exploitable weaknesses.
- ✅ Implemented local judge-panel package at `backend/app/evals/part_a/` with Pydantic schemas, teacher-packet builder, deterministic gates, offline heuristic judge client, Gemini-swappable client, aggregator, and CLI.
- ✅ Added seven judge prompt templates under `eval/judges/part_a/`, including J6 `Appeal-Vector Capture` to grade whether Aegis finds the synthetic case's embedded flaw.
- ✅ Added focused unit tests: `env UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv run pytest tests/unit/evals/test_part_a_judge_panel.py -q` → 6 passed.
- ⚠️ Same-model judging is accepted: Gemini 3.1 Pro will judge Gemini 3.1 Pro drafts; mitigations are deterministic gates, single-dimension prompts, evidence-first scoring, quote validation, calibration, and human spot checks.
- ⚠️ Broad `tests/unit` remains blocked by pre-existing stale import `from app.agent` in `tests/unit/agent/test_aegis_v1_agent.py` (Session 18 issue family).

## Learning loop design (Session 21, 2026-05-30)
The self-improvement loop has been designed end-to-end (brainstorming) →
[`docs/specs/2026-05-30-learning-coordinator-design.md`](../specs/2026-05-30-learning-coordinator-design.md).
Key reframe (as of Session 21): the drafter was deterministic templating (no evolvable surface) and the
judge panel's signal never reached Phoenix — both addressed by substrate fixes F1–F7 before the
Learning Coordinator itself. **Plan 1 (substrate F1–F7) is written:**
[`docs/plans/2026-05-30-learning-loop-substrate-plan.md`](../plans/2026-05-30-learning-loop-substrate-plan.md)
— 9 TDD tasks, fully offline-testable. **Next: execute Plan 1**, then write Plan 2 (the Learning
Coordinator itself: per-dimension specialists + experiment harness + HITL gate). See the
orientation map ([`orientation-map.md`](orientation-map.md)) for the built-vs-designed picture and
`graphify-out/` for a queryable repo graph.

## Learning loop substrate BUILT (Session 22, 2026-05-30)
Plan 1 (substrate F1–F7) was executed end-to-end, subagent-driven, fully offline (no GCP). Now in code:
- **Drafter is LLM-driven** via an injected `DrafterLLMClient` (`StubDrafterClient` offline /
  `GeminiDrafterClient` prod) behind deterministic guardrails — the fixed template is gone.
- **Student is 6 tools**; the **Outcome Simulator** is relocated out of the agent. It now runs in the
  orchestration layer (`aegis_v1/appeal_orchestrator.run_appeal_with_outcome`, exposed at
  `POST /v1/appeal`) and in the eval harness (`evals/part_a/evaluated_run.run_evaluated_case`), via an
  injectable `SimulatorClient` (stub / `GeminiSimulatorClient`). `AppealPackage` no longer carries
  `simulator_result`.
- **`run_evaluated_case`** joins Student → record trace → judges (+ optional simulator) → writes a
  **firewall-safe laundered** eval signal to a `PhoenixRecorder` (`InMemoryPhoenixRecorder` offline /
  `OtelPhoenixRecorder` prod).
- **Prompts colocated** per backend; `playbooks/` created with a convention doc.
- **Tests:** 35 offline unit tests green (`tests/unit/{aegis_v1,evals,agent}`); a GCP-ready live
  integration test (`tests/integration/test_live_appeal.py`) auto-skips without ADC.

**Open (Plan 2):** the Learning Coordinator itself; live Phoenix MCP *reads* (`phoenix_mcp_lookup`
still a stub). (The Outcome Simulator's two-step transparent scoring is now **built** — see Session 23
below.) See [learnings.md](learnings.md) Session 22.

## Outcome Simulator two-step transparent scoring BUILT (Session 23, 2026-05-31)
The simulator is now a transparent two-step function, executed subagent-driven over the 6-task plan
([`docs/plans/2026-05-31-outcome-simulator-two-step-plan.md`](../plans/2026-05-31-outcome-simulator-two-step-plan.md);
spec [`docs/specs/2026-05-30-outcome-simulator-two-step-design.md`](../specs/2026-05-30-outcome-simulator-two-step-design.md)).
The `threshold=10` hack and the old single-LLM-call `simulate` path are deleted. Now in code:
- **LLM does fuzzy judgment only** (`SimulatorClient.assess` → `FeatureAssessment`): critique-first, then
  per-feature 1/3/5 anchors + evidence. The schema/prompt forbid it emitting a score or verdict (INV-S3).
  Inputs are insurer-visible only — `denial_text`/`clinical_context`/`appeal_letter`, no answer key (INV-S4).
- **Deterministic scorer** (`aegis_v1/simulator_scoring.score_outcome`): pure function of (LLM anchors,
  published `eval/simulator_rules.json`). score = Σ(weight·anchor)/max_anchor; APPROVE iff score ≥ 0.70
  AND every must-have feature ≥ anchor 3 (must-have veto). Emits `feature_scores` + `gaps` + `critique`
  for auditability (INV-S2). `eval/simulator_rules.json` is now the published rubric (6 features, weights
  sum to 1.0; `rebuts_specific_flaw` is the must-have) — its old unused gate content was overwritten.
- **`SimulatorResult`** now carries a float `score` (0.0–1.0), float `threshold` (0.70), `feature_scores`,
  `gaps`, `critique`. `tools.simulator()` composes `assess → load_simulator_rules → score_outcome`; it
  stays out of the Student's tool list (INV-S1) and feeds `POST /v1/appeal` + `run_evaluated_case` unchanged.
- **Math (test-asserted):** uniform(1)→0.2 DENY, uniform(5)→1.0 APPROVE, weak-v1→0.38 DENY,
  must-have-veto-despite-0.84→DENY. Weights/threshold are principled, not tuned to the demo arc (INV-S5).
- **Tests:** offline acceptance green — `tests/unit/{aegis_v1,evals,agent}` 48 passed; the GCP-ready
  `tests/integration/test_live_appeal.py` auto-skips (2 skipped) without ADC. Commits `b380469..89f737f`.
- **Deferred:** per-insurer rule sets; live-Gemini calibration of the weights/threshold against the
  benchmark (verify, never hand-tune); any Learning-Coordinator evolution of the rubric (Plan 2).
- **Live-agent bug fixed (was pre-existing, commit `7dec151`):** the *drafter* ADK tool exposed a DI
  `client: "DrafterLLMClient | None"` param whose type is imported lazily inside the body; with
  `from __future__ import annotations`, ADK's tool-schema builder called `get_type_hints()` on that
  forward ref at agent-run time and raised `NameError: DrafterLLMClient`, breaking the live `aegis_v1`
  agent + e2e server (offline unit tests never hit it). Fix: split into a clean ADK-facing `drafter()`
  wrapper (no DI seam in the model's tool schema) + an injectable `draft_appeal(..., client=None)` core
  (pipeline/tests use the core). Added regression tests (every registered tool's hints must resolve; no
  registered tool may expose a `client` param) and gave the live ADK-agent/server-e2e integration tests
  the same ADC skip-guard as `test_live_appeal.py`. Now: unit **51 passed**, `tests/integration` **6
  skipped** cleanly offline. The simulator was never affected (not a registered ADK tool, INV-S1).

## Learning Coordinator (Plan 2) — offline machinery BUILT (Session 24, 2026-05-31)
Phase 1 of the v2 plan is done: the full GEPA-faithful Learning Coordinator now exists as the offline
package `backend/app/learning/`, executed subagent-driven over the 12-task plan
([`docs/plans/2026-05-31-learning-coordinator-offline-plan.md`](../plans/2026-05-31-learning-coordinator-offline-plan.md);
spec [`docs/specs/2026-05-31-learning-coordinator-v2-gepa-design.md`](../specs/2026-05-31-learning-coordinator-v2-gepa-design.md)).
All 12 tasks green; commits `9f048f7..53f1eaf`. Now in code:
- **`models.py`** — `Component`/`Candidate`/`ScoredRun`/`DimensionSignal`/`ExperimentResult`/`PromotionProposal`
  + `composite_score` (weighted, hard-gated; all-5→1.0, all-1→0.2, gate-fail→0.0). Rubric weights:
  grounding .30, appeal_vector_capture .25, case_specific_clinical_rebuttal .20, evidence_completeness .15,
  persuasive_coherence .10.
- **`store.py`** — `PhoenixLearningStore` Protocol (the ONLY contract to Phoenix, INV-1) +
  `InMemoryPhoenixLearningStore` fake (reads back recorded runs, versions components, `register_promotion`
  appends only changed versions).
- **`signal.py`** — `acquire_signal()` reads the gradient FROM Phoenix, picks the weakest rubric dimension,
  collects **laundered** notes; returns `None` when Phoenix has no signal (INV-1 halt). `FORBIDDEN_FIELDS`
  firewall (INV-2) strips answer-key keys — **including on the `failing_cases` runs that feed the reflection
  minibatch** (a genuine plan bug a subagent caught and we fixed in `dab6dc0`; defence in depth).
- **`reflection_client.py`** — `ReflectionClient` Protocol + `StubReflectionClient` (deterministic
  constructive edit, tags target dimension) + `Gemini`/`Anthropic` backends (cloud SDK imports method-local,
  construction-only tested) + critique-first `build_reflection_prompt` (firewall holds in the prompt too).
- **`selection.py`/`mutation.py`/`merge.py`/`gates.py`** — pure GEPA mechanics: instance-wise Pareto
  frontier + coverage select + round-robin `select_component`; single-component `reflective_mutate` with
  lineage+credit (V2-INV-2); `system_aware_merge` of complementary lineages (None on conflict);
  `evaluate_vetoes` (held-out regression, safety/hard-gate, `simulator_approve_but_judges_fail` (INV-3),
  diff>200 tokens).
- **`experiment.py`** — `StubExperimentRunner` (deterministic monotone scorer — targeted dims bump 1→3→5,
  gives the loop a real gradient) + `LiveExperimentRunner` (real drafter+judge, construction-safe, run() is
  live-only). **`coordinator.py`** — `LearningCoordinator.optimize()` (Phoenix-signal probe → seed → reflect/
  select/merge rounds → `PromotionProposal`) + HITL `promote()`. **`efficacy_harness.py`** — `run_efficacy()`
  reports held-out lift for any injected backend; refuses to measure on the train split (V2-INV-3).
- **Tests:** `tests/unit/learning/*` **35 passed**; full `tests/unit` suite **86 passed** offline.
  Build-breaking invariant tests: INV-1 (no-signal → `optimize()` returns None), INV-2 (firewall in signal
  + prompt), V2-INV-2 (one component/child), V2-INV-3 (held-out-only). No module-top cloud imports.
- **Deferred to the companion (GCP/live) plan:** real `PhoenixLearningStore` over MCP/SDK; the
  `judge_client.score(...)` adapter over the Part-A panel; real Gemini/Anthropic drafter+judge+reflection;
  the stagnation from-scratch restart (needs re-recorded signal between promotions); measured +20% lift,
  κ≥0.6 calibration, MCP-off counterfactual, DENY→APPROVE demo capture.
- **Phase 2 (DONE, Session 24) — real efficacy measured.** Assistant-orchestrated manual GEPA run with
  the Claude session as the drafter/judge/reflection intelligence (no API keys) over the real synthetic
  cases. Optimized the Student drafter prompt for its weakest *promptable* dimension
  (`appeal_vector_capture`): **held-out composite 0.73 → 0.88 = +0.15 abs / +20.5% rel**, no vetoes,
  promotable — meeting the v1 §12 target on cases the reflection never saw, INV-2 firewall intact.
  `drafter_v1.md → drafter_v2.md` (+131-token focused reflection: "confront the denial's strongest
  stated ground head-on" + "audit for missing procedural/appeal-rights disclosures"); promoted in
  `tools.py` (now loads `drafter_v2`). Run captured under `eval/efficacy_runs/2026-05-31/`
  (inputs/drafts/judgments/reflections/result.json + prep/score scripts) and locked as an offline
  replay regression (`backend/tests/unit/learning/test_efficacy_run_fixture.py`, 4 tests). Full unit
  suite **90 passed**. Evidence doc + honest caveats (small N, single round, Claude-judges-Claude,
  grounding corpus-bound) in [`docs/evals/2026-05-31-coordinator-efficacy-run.md`](../evals/2026-05-31-coordinator-efficacy-run.md). Commit `2c21d33`.
  **Deferred:** round 2+ (next promptable dimension) + full 10/10 split; the Gemini-drafts + independent-judge
  + κ≥0.6 re-run lands in the companion GCP plan (these prompts are its starting point).
- **Next work planned (Session 24, ready to execute).** Two plans written + a Session-25 handoff:
  - **Tier 2 (offline, now):** [`docs/plans/2026-05-31-learning-efficacy-tier2-offline-plan.md`](../plans/2026-05-31-learning-efficacy-tier2-offline-plan.md) — extract a tested `efficacy_io` module, run efficacy round 2 on the full 10/10 split, A/B the reflection meta-prompt.
  - **Tier 1 (live, credential-gated):** [`docs/plans/2026-05-31-learning-coordinator-live-gcp-companion-plan.md`](../plans/2026-05-31-learning-coordinator-live-gcp-companion-plan.md) — the submission thesis: live `phoenix_mcp_lookup` (T4.1), `LivePhoenixLearningStore`, live Gemini+Phoenix coordinator, the **MCP-off counterfactual** demo, κ≥0.6 judge calibration. Offline cores are TDD'd against fixtures; network calls gated behind `_creds_available()`.
  - Runbook + order (Tier 2 first) + the MCP-auth critical path are in [`session-25-execution-handoff.md`](session-25-execution-handoff.md).

## Tier 2 EXECUTED — offline efficacy hardened (Session 25, 2026-06-01)
Tier 2 ran end-to-end, subagent-driven, fully offline (no GCP/API key), commits `1ae716e..ef04cda`.
Evidence: [`docs/evals/2026-06-01-coordinator-efficacy-run2.md`](../evals/2026-06-01-coordinator-efficacy-run2.md).
- **Task 1 — `efficacy_io` extracted + tested.** The throwaway Phase-2 scripts are now the reusable,
  unit-tested `backend/app/learning/efficacy_io.py` (firewall packet prep + composite scoring +
  weakest-promptable selection + lift/veto reporting), pinned to the Run #1 fixtures; the Run #1 scripts
  import it and re-emit a byte-identical `result.json`. (4 new tests.)
- **Task 2 — Round 2 on the FULL 11-case train split → offline ceiling reached, NO promotion.**
  `drafter_v2` scores at the promptable ceiling on every prompt-movable dimension (avc/cscr/evidence =
  5.0, persuasive_coherence = 4.82 ≥ 4.8); only corpus-bound `grounding` (3.0) stays low and is
  unmovable offline. Honest-result clause invoked: no `drafter_v3` manufactured; `drafter_v2` stays
  active. This confirms Run #1's +20.5% was not a 4-case artifact. Replay regression extended.
- **Task 3 — reflection meta-prompt A/B → `base` wins.** Added a tested `variant` param to
  `build_reflection_prompt` (+`critique_plus`). On the fixed v1→appeal_vector_capture task (4-case
  held-out): base 0.88 (+20.5%, 129 added words) beat critique_plus 0.835 (+14.4%, 40 added words) —
  the minimal edit was 3.2× tighter but under-captured on held-out. `base` stays default; `critique_plus`
  retained (tested) for Tier-1 re-evaluation.
- **Tests:** full `tests/unit` **97 passed** offline; no test makes a cloud/API call.
- **Net:** offline prompt optimization has reached its ceiling on all promptable dims; the remaining
  headroom (`grounding`) and the cross-model efficacy read both require **Tier 1 (live GCP/Phoenix)** —
  now the clear next step. `drafter_v2` + the `base` meta-prompt are Tier 1's starting point.

## Tier 1 offline cores BUILT (Session 25 cont., 2026-06-01) — creds still required for the live thesis
Built the credential-FREE parts of the Tier 1 plan (`docs/plans/2026-05-31-learning-coordinator-live-gcp-companion-plan.md`)
ahead of GCP/Phoenix setup, TDD, commits `8a35860`,`5720eaf`. Full unit **103 passed**; integration skips clean offline.
- **Task 1 `PanelJudgeAdapter`** (`backend/app/learning/judge_adapter.py`) — adapts the Part-A panel to the
  `judge_client.score(case, appeal_letter)` contract; the deferred glue that makes `LiveExperimentRunner` runnable.
- **Task 5 `counterfactual.run_counterfactual`** (`backend/app/learning/counterfactual.py`) — MCP-on-vs-off composite
  delta harness (the load-bearing-MCP demo), pure over injected callables.
- **Task 6 `calibration.cohens_kappa`/`calibration_report`** (`backend/app/evals/part_a/calibration.py`) — quadratic-weighted
  Cohen's κ on the 1/3/5 scale + the κ≥0.6 gate.
- **STILL NEEDS CREDS (next session, credentialed box):** **Task 0** (resolve Phoenix MCP auth + record real
  `backend/tests/fixtures/phoenix/*` payloads — the critical path; fallback to `px.Client()` reads if MCP auth can't be
  settled). **Tasks 2 & 3** (`LivePhoenixLearningStore` transforms + `phoenix_mcp_lookup` trace-summary) were deliberately
  HELD because they parse real Phoenix payloads whose field names Task 0's fixtures pin — building them against guessed
  schemas would be false-green. **Task 4** (`run_live.py` live coordinator), **Task 7** (demo capture), and all gated
  smoke tests need `gcloud auth application-default login` (ADC) + `PHOENIX_API_KEY`
  (+ likely `PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS="api_key=$PHOENIX_API_KEY"`, `PHOENIX_HOST`, `PHOENIX_PROJECT=aegis-hackathon`).

## 2026-06-02 — v1 librarian + consumer UX wiring (uncommitted)

- **Status:** v1 librarian/discovery flow runs end-to-end; backend unit tests green.
- **Defaults:** Gemini `location=global`, model `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (verified available in this project).
- **UX:** top-nav shows a green dot when the backend is connected (next to Settings).
- **Still pending:** commit scope (repo has a very large dirty tree under `eval/cases/` + other unrelated WIP).

## 2026-06-02 — Gumloop prompt-pass cleanup of draft denial cases (01–500)

- **Goal:** run the full Gumloop prompt suite over synthetic denial-case drafts and apply revisions where needed.
- **Outputs:**
  - `eval/gumloop_runs/manual-llm-sample/01-10-full-swarm/swarm_report.json`
  - `eval/gumloop_runs/manual-llm-sample/11-500-full-swarm-batches/index.json`
  - Per-batch reports: `eval/gumloop_runs/manual-llm-sample/11-500-full-swarm-batches/<batch>/batch_report.json`
  - One-page overview: `eval/gumloop_runs/manual-llm-sample/11-500-full-swarm-batches/SUMMARY.md`
- **Key cleanup applied across drafts:**
  - Removed the repeated template tail in `clinical_context` (“This directly contradicts…”) and replaced with schema-safe chart-note style text
  - Repaired corrupted peer-to-peer sentence splices in `denial_letter_text`
  - Fixed rare impossible demographics (male + postmenopausal osteoporosis)
  - Normalized stray “age XX” artifacts when they contradicted `patient_profile.age`

## 2026-06-04 — Case 12 draft repaired for Gumloop/teacher-packet alignment

- **Fixed** `eval/cases/drafts/case_12_aetna_priorauth.json` after manual 17-critic review.
- **Root cause:** the denial letter claimed `ignored_physician_letter` in `denial_pattern_sources` but also explicitly referenced submitted documentation/clinical notes, so the intended flaw was not actually present.
- **Also corrected** stale `synthetic_provenance` text that described a different case (`step-therapy` / named-drug language) and would have polluted the teacher packet’s hidden appeal vectors.
- **Judge-path alignment checked:** narrowed the hidden `appeal_difficulty` vectors to the two declared pattern anchors only, so `J6 appeal_vector_capture` and any downstream learning signal stay aligned with `denial_pattern_sources`.
- **System fix:** `build_teacher_grading_packet()` now parses Gumloop-style `pattern_id: source` entries before matching `eval/denial_patterns.json`; this makes source-of-truth expected vectors come from the declared Gumloop flaw IDs instead of relying on fallback hidden metadata.
- **Verification:** JSON parsed cleanly; `build_teacher_grading_packet()` now emits coherent `expected_appeal_vectors` with no `risk_flags`; backend eval-path tests passed under Python 3.11 from `backend/`.

## 2026-06-06 — V1 showcase quick/serious execution foundation built

- **Built:** `/showcase` now has a quick/serious live-learning control surface. Quick run starts through `POST /v1/showcase/runs/quick`, returns a `session_id` immediately, polls `GET /v1/showcase/runs/{session_id}`, can cancel, and can approve when a GEPA proposal is ready. Serious run endpoint exists and is locked until quick success.
- **Manifest:** fixed read-only v1 manifest at `eval/benchmarks/v1_showcase_100/manifest.json`. Quick cohort is targeted Cigna + medical necessity: cases 01, 07, 13, 19, 22, 30, 35, 45, 46, 48. Serious holdout is cases 91-100. Draft case files were not modified.
- **Backend correctness:** promotion wiring now writes drafter prompts to runtime-loadable filenames and updates `active_drafter_prompt.txt`; `LivePhoenixLearningStore` now writes playbooks to root `playbooks/`, matching `playbook_loader`. Measurement runner disables Phoenix memory reads by parameter and uses drafter + simulator only.
- **Diagnostics:** JSON session ledger defaults to `/tmp/aegis_showcase_sessions` or `AEGIS_SHOWCASE_LEDGER_DIR`, with stage, session id, case counts, last error, retryability, Phoenix trace ids, and Cloud Run log filter.
- **Runner caveat:** quick background runner is implemented and gated by `AEGIS_SHOWCASE_AUTORUN` (default true). It requires `PHOENIX_API_KEY` and Google ADC; missing creds persist a clear failed session. Approval promotes and runs post-measurement. Serious-run execution body is not yet implemented beyond locked start/poll shell.
- **Verification:** targeted backend showcase tests 16 passed; corrected pipeline prompt-version test passed; frontend `tsc`, `npm run test -- --run`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` passed. Full backend unit suite had unrelated pre-existing failures: case generator natural anchor, missing `case_500_*` fixture tests, and `/tmp/harness` setup.

## Next recommended action

**Updated 2026-05-28 (Session 18):** Before any feature work, the next agent must resolve the inconsistencies identified in the audit. PM wants to review each issue individually — see Session 18 handoff in `agent-handoffs.md` for the full 16-item table with recommendations.

**Priority order:**
1. **Fix dev.sh syntax bug** (issue #1) — blocks all development. Likely OK to fix without PM debate since it's a plain bug.
2. **PM review of issues #2–#16** — go through each one with PM before fixing.
3. **Phoenix project name decision** (issues #10–#12) — blocks T4.1 (live MCP wiring).
4. **Gemini/cloud calibration for Part A judge panel** — once GCP is configured, run the seven judge prompts against calibration examples; offline heuristic scores are diagnostic only.
5. **T3.5 demo capture** — time-sensitive; cannot be recreated after prompt is patched.
6. **T4.1 live Phoenix MCP** — load-bearing demo feature.
7. **G1 critic model revisiting is no longer viable as originally written** if Gemini-only judging remains a hard constraint; use same-model mitigations instead.

**A4 gate is PASSED.** Next hard gates to watch: **A2 (Phoenix UI demo-viability — Day 2)**, **A3 (case credibility — Day 3)**, **A1 (eval signal — Day 5)**.

**Demo capture reminder:** First recording happens on **Day 3** when the v1 agent runs for the first time. See `docs/demo/rolling-capture-checklist.md`.
